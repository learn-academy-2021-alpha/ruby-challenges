# Arithmetic Challenges
# Remember that floats are numbers with a decimal point whereas integers have no fractional part so in Ruby, 1 and 1.0 are different types of things with slightly different behaviors.
#
# Add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers and floats.

# p 1+3
# p 5-3
# p 42-2+2
# p 25*4
# p 12/2
#
# p 3.0+4.2
# p 15.5 - 0.5
# p (6.7*8.8).round(0)
# p 6.2-7.0
# p 6.2-7
# p 6.2/7
# p (6.2-7).round(0)
#
#
# # Find the remainder of dividing two numbers using the modulo operator (%).
#
# p 5%47
# p 47%5
# p 48%5
# # Divide a number by 0.
#
# # p 6/0
#
# # Divide 0 by 0.
#
# # p 0/0
# p 5.0/0
# p 0.0/0



# Variables Challenges
# Set a variable called my_favorite_number equal to your favorite number

# my_favorite_number = 18
# p my_favorite_number
#
# # Calculate your favorite number divided by 2
#
# p my_favorite_number/2
#
# # Set another variable called someones_favorite equal to 13
#
# someones_favorite = 13
# p someones_favorite
#
# # Change the value of someones_favorite to 7
#
# someones_favorite = 7
# p someones_favorite
#
# # Subtract my_favorite_number from someones_favorite
#
# p someones_favorite - my_favorite_number
#
# # Change the value of my favorite number to be 26 times its current value
#
# p my_favorite_number = my_favorite_number * 26
# p my_favorite_number

# Strings Challenges
# Create a variable and return it in a sentence string interpolation
# Create a variable that contains a string and test some of the Ruby string methods
# .upcase
# .reverse
# .include?
# .capitalize
# Arrays Challenges
# Create an array with five of your favorite TV shows

nums = [ 1 ,2, 3, 4 ,5]

# Find the length of the array
# From the full TV show array, extract your top 3 TV shows in a new array

top_three = [nums[0] , nums[1] , nums[2]]
p top_three


# Reverse the array
# Return one element from the array
