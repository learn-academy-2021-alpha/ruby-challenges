# Challenges: Practice with Hashes
# As a developer, I can create a hash called my_phone using the Ruby method .new.
my_phone = Hash.new 
# p my_phone


# As a developer, I can add five key:value pairs of app names and their descriptions to my hash.
my_phone[:instagram] = "pictures of people"
my_phone[:facebook] = "story feeds and comunication with friends"
my_phone[:pintrest] = "pictures of things I want to do or see"
my_phone[:amazon] = "things I want to buy"
my_phone[:netflix] = "movies and shows I want to waych"
# p my_phone

# As a developer, I can return a value from my_phone by passing in the name of a key.



# As a developer, I can update two keys in my_phone.




# As a developer, I can update two values in my_phone.
# As a developer, I can delete two key:value pairs from my_phone.
# As a developer, I can use an enumerable method to return information about all of my_phone's applications.
