# Challenge: Tasklist with TDD
# For each story:
# Copy the story into your RSpec file as a comment
# Write the test(s) that class/method tests must pass
# Then run the test(s) and see that they fail
# Then implement the class/method, with comments, so that it passes the tests one at a time
# User Stories
# Story: As a developer, I can create a Task.

describe 'When a Task is instantiated' do
  it 'does not raise an error' do
    expect {Task.new}.to_not raise_error
  end
# Story: As a developer, I can give a Task a title and retrieve it.
  it 'Task has a title' do
    my_task = Task.new
    my_task.title = 'Homework'
    expect(my_task.title).to be_a String
    expect(my_task.title).to eq 'Homework'
  end
# Story: As a developer, I can give a Task a description and retrieve it.

# Story: As a developer, I can mark a Task done. Tasks should be initialized as 'in progress'.
