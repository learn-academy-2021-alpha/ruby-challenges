# Arithmetic Challenges
# Remember that floats are numbers with a decimal point whereas integers have no fractional part so in Ruby, 1 and 1.0 are different types of things with slightly different behaviors.

# Add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers and floats.
# p 2 + 2
# p 3.4 - 2
# p 5 / 3 
# p 6 * 4
# Find the remainder of dividing two numbers using the modulo operator (%).
# p 6 % 2
# Divide a number by 0.
# p 7 / 0
# Divide 0 by 0.
# p 0.0 / 0

# Variables Challenges
# Set a variable called my_favorite_number equal to your favorite number
my_favorite_number = 7.0
# Calculate your favorite number divided by 2
p my_favorite_number / 2
# Set another variable called someones_favorite equal to 13
someones_favorite = 13
p someones_favorite
# Change the value of someones_favorite to 7
someones_favorite = 7
p someones_favorite

# Subtract my_favorite_number from someones_favorite
p my_favorite_number - someones_favorite
# Change the value of my favorite number to be 26 times its current value
p my_favorite_number **= 26
p my_favorite_number = my_favorite_number ** 26
p my_favorite_number
# Strings Challenges
# Create a variable and return it in a sentence string interpolation
# Create a variable that contains a string and test some of the Ruby string methods
# .upcase
# .reverse

# .capitalize
# Arrays Challenges
